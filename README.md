### Neural Style Transfer with Deep Learning

(part of Andrew Ng's Coursera assignment)

The goal of this project is to merge two images, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S. 

**Example**

<img src="images/louvre_generated.png" style="width:750px;height:300px;">
